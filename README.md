# Advanced Machine Learning - Transformer-Architecture

This repository features work I completed for the *Advanced Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence* course in UChicago's Applied Data Analytics program. In these code examples, I explore Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Large Language Model (LLM) methods using a GPU in Google Cloud Platform.

**Table of Contents**
- ML-AI 1: Matrix Multiplication (GPU and CPU)
- ML-AI 2: Pipelines: Translation, Summary and Q&A
- ML-AI 3: Tokenization and Text Classifiers
- ML-AI 4: Build a Transformer (*implement a decoder, train on translation task, compare performance to TensorFlow*)
- ML-AI 5: Part of Speech (POS) Token Classification
